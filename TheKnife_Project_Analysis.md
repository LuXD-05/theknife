# TheKnife Project Analysis

## Project Overview

TheKnife is a Java-based restaurant information and review system built with JavaFX. The application appears to focus on Michelin restaurants, providing users with detailed restaurant information, reviews, and ratings. The system uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and leverages modern Java features (Java 21) with Lombok for reduced boilerplate code.

```

### Design Patterns

Based on the analyzed code, the project implements several design patterns:

1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** - Separates the application into Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (business logic)
2. **Repository Pattern** - Abstracts data access through repository classes
3. **Builder Pattern** - Implemented via Lombok's @Accessors(chain = true) for fluent APIs
4. **Dependency Injection** - Likely used for service and repository dependencies

## Data Model Analysis

### Core Entities

- **Restaurant**: Represents a restaurant with detailed information
- **User**: Represents a system user with personal information and authentication details
- **Review**: Contains a user's review of a restaurant including ratings and content
- **Role**: Represents user roles for authorization

### Data Flow
